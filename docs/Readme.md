# Welcome to BrowEdit!

## Installation
Just unzip browedit3.zip somewhere on your hard disk and you're good to go. Before you had to edit configuration files, now browedit comes with a [configuration editor](Configuration.md). The first time you launch browedit you will get the  window. You can always open this again through the |Edit|Configure| menu options. In the configuration window, make sure you add your grf file and set up your RO directory. Sometimes the browse buttons crash, then just copy/paste or type the paths manually.

## General Controls
Browedit3 is based on different panels that can be docked. When you drag the top part of a window, you'll get some little help icons on where to dock this window. It is also possible to drag windows out of the main window, so you can use multiple computer screens. A lot of boxes where you can enter numbers can be dragged to change the value with your mouse. On those textboxes, doubleclick or ctrl+click to manually type values

## Camera stuff
Browedit uses a simple camera system that rotates around a point that can be moved. You can control it using the middle mouse button (and the right mouse button too for now)
* Middle mouse button to move the camera
* Shift+middle mouse button to rotate the camera
* Scrollwheel to zoom

 ## Edit modes
 
* [Object Edit](ObjectEdit.md)
* [Texture Edit (todo)]()
* [Height Edit (todo)]()
* [Wall Edit (todo)]()
* [Gat Edit (todo)]()

## Lightmapping
see [Lightmapping](Lightmapping.md)


## Buglist
* [x] When dragging a map outside of the main browedit window, it can not be interacted with
* [ ] This software crashes

## Bug reporting
When browedit3 crashes, you should get a popup window with some information about the crash. Click the 'more' button to view the error report, then click on 'save' to save a zipfile with the bugreport. This might include a screenshot, a minidump and an xml file. Just send this file in the browedit3 channel on discord
