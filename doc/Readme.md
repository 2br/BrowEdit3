# Welcome to BrowEdit!

## Installation
Just unzip browedit3.zip somewhere on your hard disk and you're good to go. Before you had to edit configuration files, now browedit comes with a [configuration editor](Configuration.md). The first time you launch browedit you will get the  window. You can always open this again through the |Edit|Configure| menu options. In the configuration window, make sure you add your grf file and set up your RO directory. Sometimes the browse buttons crash, then just copy/paste or type the paths manually.

## General Controls
Browedit3 is based on different panels that can be docked. When you drag the top part of a window, you'll get some little help icons on where to dock this window. It is also possible to drag windows out of the main window, so you can use multiple computer screens. A lot of boxes where you can enter numbers can be dragged to change the value with your mouse. On those textboxes, doubleclick or ctrl+click to manually type values

## Camera stuff
Browedit uses a simple camera system that rotates around a point that can be moved. You can control it using the middle mouse button (and the right mouse button too for now)
* Middle mouse button to move the camera
* Shift+middle mouse button to rotate the camera
* Scrollwheel to zoom

 ## Edit modes
 
* [Object Edit](ObjectEdit.md)
* [Texture Edit (todo)]()
* [Height Edit (todo)]()
* [Wall Edit (todo)]()
* [Gat Edit (todo)]()


## Buglist
* [x] When dragging a map outside of the main browedit window, it can not be interacted with
* [ ] This software crashes

## Bug reporting
When browedit3 crashes, you should get a popup window with some information about the crash. Click the 'more' button to view the error report, then click on 'save' to save a zipfile with the bugreport. This might include a screenshot, a minidump and an xml file. In order for me to actually use this report, the .pdb file is needed in order to map the error report to the source code. The .pdb file is included in the browedit3 zipfile, so add this to the .zip file, then send it over on discord

## Todo
* [ ] Make sure the maps load properly ingame
* [ ] Add undo to 'replace selected models' action
* [ ] Add button to hide textures on mapview
* [ ] Hotkeys for changing translate/rotate/scale
* [ ] Filter for filenames
* [ ] Make lights, effects and sounds visible and clickable
