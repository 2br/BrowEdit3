# Configuration
Browedit is configured using the configuration window in the application. The data is saved in a config.json file. You can also edit this file manually if you'd like. The important bits in the config are

* RO Directory: the directory where your RO client is stored
* GRF files: The grf files your client uses. These can be over 2GB
* Field of view: the field of view of the editor view
* Camera Mouse Speed: the camera movement uses the 2D mouse location at the moment. Use this to make the camera move faster. In the future, the plan is to make the camera use the 3D mouse location, then this option shouldn't be needed anymore
* Style: You can set either dark or light theme here.
	* There is a style editor button here too. In the style editor, you can make a custom theme. In the window that pops up, go to the colors tab, and change the colors to the colors you'd like. After you're done, export the colors to clipboard, and send the clipboard to borf to get a custom theme. To close the style editor, click the style editor button again
* Background Color: the background color of the 3D map view
* Object Window Thumbnail Size: the size of the thumbnails in the object picker in object edit mode
* Close object window when adding a model: Some users might prefer to have the object window pop up fullscreen when clicking the button, then select a model, and then have it close automatically again. Other users might prefer to have the object select window docked in the bottom. Use this checkbox to toggle this behaviour. If this checkbox is not selected, the object picker will be opened on startup too
